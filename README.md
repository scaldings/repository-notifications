# repository-notifications
This script checks for a user's repositories and sends  
you an email whenever the user creates a new repository.  
  
If you want to automate this process without this running  
on your computer, you can use Heroku Hosting for free to  
host your scripts and other stuff. https://www.heroku.com/
